# Alternative UML Representations
We've created 2 versions of the OMS Diagrams:
- With all the associations shown explicitly
- With associations overlapping when they have the same target

First version is more explicit, 2nd easier for some eyes. We need to decide which version to provide in Annex E of the standard.

Please put your name under the diagram version you prefer
