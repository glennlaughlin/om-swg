## AnyFeature
Note: while we cannot define this feature, we should describe it
### UML Notes
The class AnyFeature is an instance of the «metaclass» FeatureType (ISO 19109). It represents the set of all classes which are feature types. 

NOTE      AnyFeature is implemented in GML (ISO 19136:2007) by the element gml:AbstractFeature and type gml:AbstractFeatureType. 

In an implementation this abstract class shall be substituted by a concrete class representing a feature type from an application schema associated with a domain of discourse (ISO 19109, ISO 19101). 

*Note: this is taken from the V2 Observation, must be reworked.*

Note: based on current discussions, we may propose an interface to provide the link back to an Observation
